description: A new Flutter application.

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
   - images/Meister_von_San_Vitale_in_Ravenna_013.jpg
   - images/220px-Statue-Augustus.jpg
   - images/220px-Timur_reconstruction03.jpg

   - images/Aetius-Flavius.jpg
   - images/Gustavus_Adolphus_II_of_Sweden1.jpg
   - images/hannibal barca.jpg
   - images/king_charles_xii_of_sweden.jpg
   - images/marcus_aurelius.jpg
   - images/pic1 (3).jpg
   - images/pic1 (4).jpg
   - images/pic1 (5).jpg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.io/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Ubuntu
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Ubuntu-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/Ubuntu-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/Ubuntu-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
    - family: Open Sans
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Regular.ttf
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Italic.ttf
          style: italic
        - asset: fonts/OpenSans-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
